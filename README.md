# plot_coef

This repository contains the code and data for the Population Health Research Group (PHRG) tutorial on plotting coefficients in R. The dataset is shared by Dr. Lystad, one of the two authors of [this paper](https://injepijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40621-018-0174-7?from=timeline&isappinstalled=0). Like the authors, we will attempt to calculate the mortality risk of fictional characters from Game of Thrones. The point of this exercise is not to conduct survival analysis, but to visualize outputs through plotting coefficients from scratch in R. The video associated with this tutorial is available to all University of St. Andrews PHRG members, or by special request.
